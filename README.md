# Introducrtion
This is the group project 1 - simulation study for p8160 course. 

# Data generation and simulation design

All codes related to generate data are in DataGeneration folder, Generator.R . Other documents are related to two methods & estimation 

# Implement the simualtion on your own workplace

If you want to reproduce the whole process, use Simulation.R in the main direct. The simualtion results of question 1 and 2 will be put in SimResult1 folder and SimResult2 respectively. The simulation parameter settings are stored in SimGrid.csv 

# Plots and figures in the report

Plots and figures in the final report are in the Analysis.rmd and Analysis2.rmd for two questions
